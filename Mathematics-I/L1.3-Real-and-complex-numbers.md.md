### Recap
- So, in previous [[L1.2-Rational-numbers.md |lecture]] we discussed that:
- - Rational numbers are Dense
- - Between $2$ rational numbers, we can find infinite $\infty$ no. of rational numbers.
- An integer is also a rational number, because we write it in a fraction with denominator $1$
- - Examples:
$$\frac{7}{1}, \frac{3}{1}, \frac{4}{1}, \frac{56}{1}$$
- So, the question is can all rational numbers fill up the number line ?
- Answer is **NO**!, let's see...

### Real numbers
- For every integer $m$, it's square is $m^2 = m \cdot m$
- Similarly, Square root of $m$ is $r = \sqrt{m}$
- such that $r \cdot r  = m$
- So, if we take prefect squares like $4, 16, 25, 64, 100, \dots$
- There sqrt is also an integer like $2, 4, 5, 8, 10,\dots$
- What if sqrt of some number is not an integer like $2, 10$
- So, the smallest number which is not a perfect square is $2$
- It's sqrt $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be written in $\frac{p}{q}$ form.
- But, we can draw a line of $\sqrt{2}$ length.
- We all know *Pythagoras theorem*, which says that:
$$a^2 = b^2 + c^2$$
- or, we can also say it as:
$$a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2}$$
- where, 
- - $a$ is the *hypotenuse*
- - $b$ & $c$ can be *perpendicular* or *base*.

- If we draw a triangle with base $1$ and perpendicular $1$.
- Then, it's *hypotenuse* will be $\sqrt{2}$
$$\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}$$

- $\sqrt{2}$ is measurable, but cannot be written as a rational number.
- $\sqrt{2}$ is called an ***irrational* number**.

#### Irrational numbers
These are the numbers which can be represent on a number line, but cannot be written in $\frac{p}{q}$ form.
```

- So, the numbers which constitutes all the rational and irrational numbers are called **Real numbers**.
- **Real numbers** are denoted by $\mathbb{R}$
- Real numbers are also dense just like *rational* numbers.
- B/w any $2$ real numbers, we can find many more real numbers.

### Common irrational numbers
- There are various irrational numbers exist, which we use very commonly.
- Like:
- $\pi$  *pi*, is the ratio of circumference to the diameter of a circle.
$$\pi = 3.1415927\dots$$
- $e$ is *Euler's* no, used for natural logarithms.
$$e = 2.7182818\dots$$
- Any number whose sqrt is not a perfect square it's square root is an irrational number.

### Are we limited to Real numbers only ?

- So, is the end of number line till *Real numbers* only ?
- **NO**!
- What if we take square root of negative numbers, like $\sqrt{-3}$
- We know that the multiplication rules say that:
- - If we multiply $2$ positive numbers, then we get positive result, similar in the case of negative.
- - But, if we have different signs, $1$ negative and $1$ positive, then we get result in negative.
- Same for square roots, if we multiply $2$ positive square roots, we get a positive number.
- But, what if we to find square roots of negative numbers or we have negative square roots ?
- Then it is to be considered in **Complex** numbers.
- So, complex numbers extend the real numbers.
- Complex numbers are denoted by $\mathbb{C}$
