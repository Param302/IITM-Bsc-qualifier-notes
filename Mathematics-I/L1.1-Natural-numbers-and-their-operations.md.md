### Natural numbers
#### Numbers
- We use numbers to count objects.
- $0$ represent no object at all

#### Natural numbers
- Numbers starting from $0$ are called **Natural numbers**.
- And, it ends with *infinity* ($\infty$).
- We represents a set of **Natural Numbers** using $\mathbb{N}$ 
- $\mathbb{N} = \left\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4,\dots, \infty \right\}$
- It includes $0$ also.

#### Basic operations on Natural numbers
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

#### Question: Which of these operations always produce a natural number ?

- Adding two natural numbers, always result in another natural number.
- Subtraction fails here
- If we subtract a bigger number from a small number, say $10 - 15$, then we don't get a natural number.
- Rather, we get a negative number, which is not a natural number.
- If we extend the natural numbers with negative numbers, then we get **Integers**.

### Integers
- Integers include all the *natural numbers* with - negative numbers.
- We can represent a set of **Integers** using $\mathbb{Z}$
- $\mathbb{Z} = \left\{-\infty, \dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots, \infty\right\}$
- So, **Integers** starts with *negative infinity* $-\infty$ and ends with *infinity* $\infty$.
- We can form a *number line*, which represents a pictorial representations of numbers.

So, now let's move back to our [[L1.1-Natural-numbers-and-their-operations.md#Question Which of these operations always produce a natural number |question]]

#### Multiplication
- Multiplying two natural numbers meaning making copying of a number $a$, $b$ times.
- $7\times4$ means, making $4$ copies of $7$.
- $m\times n = \underbrace{m + m + \dots + m}_{n \text{ times}}$
- Notation of multiplication can be:
- - $m \times n$
- - $m \cdot n$
- - $mn$
- All these $3$ can be interpreted as multiplying $m$ with $n$.
- When we have just numbers, not names, then we don't write $3^{rd}$ notation.
- For multiplying negative numbers:
- - $-m\times n = -(m \cdot n)$
- - If we have *odd* numbers of negative sign, then we get a negative number
- - $-m \times -n = m \cdot n$
- - If we have *even* numbers of positive sign, then we get a positive number

#### Exponentiation
- If we multiply a number $m$ by itself, then we call it $m^2$ ($m$ square).
- $m \times m = m^2$
- So, $4^2 = 16$.
- Means, we can arrange $16$ objects in a $6$ square.

- Now, if we multiply a number $m$ by itself $3$ times, then we call it $m^3$ ($m$ cube).
- $m \times m \times = m^3$
- So, $6^3 = 216$
- Means, we can arrange $216$ objects in a cube of $6$ by $6$ by $6$.

- So, if any number multiply by itself $k$ times, we can say $m^k$ .
- $m^k = \underbrace{m \times m \times \cdots \times m}_{k \text{ times}}$ 
- So, we can say that:
- - multiplication is repeated addition
- - Exponentiation is repeated multiplication.

#### Division
- Let's say we want to distribute $20$ mangoes to $5$ friends.
- One way, we can do it is, give a mango to each friend.
- After giving all of them, we left with $15$ mangoes.
- Now, again give a mango to each friend.
- Now, we left with $10$ mangoes.
- And, if we repeat this step $2$ more times, then we left with $0$.
- Means we distributed all of them and each of them has now $4$ mangoes.
- $20 \div 5 = 4$ 
- So, we can say that **Division is repeated subtraction**.

But, what if we have only $19$ mangoes ?
- Then, after distributing $3$ to each, we left with $4$.
- So, here $4$ is the *remainder*.
- And, $5$ is the quotient.
- We also use $mod$ operator to denote remainder like this:
- - $19\mod 5 = 4$

### Factors
- **Factor** is a number which divides a number $n$ without leaving a remainder.
- $a$ divides $b$ if $b \mod a = 0$
- where, $a$ is a factor.
- We also write factor of a number like this:
- $a \mid b$
- where, $a$ is a smaller number which completely divides $b$ (a bigger number).
- We can also say that $b$ is a multiple of $a$.
- If $a$ divides $b$, then, $a \times k = b$, where $k$ is some number, also a factor of $b$.
- Some examples of multiples and factors are:
- $4 \mid 20, 7 \mid 63$
- If a number $a$ doesn't divide $b$, then we denote it with a stroke on pipe $\nmid$
- $4 \nmid 19, 9 \nmid 100$
- So, $b \mod a = 0$ is same as $a \mid b$
- And, we write factors in a pair.
- So, factors of $12$ are:
- $\{1, 12\}, \{2, 6\}, \{3, 4\}$
- If a number is a **[[L1.1-Natural-numbers-and-their-operations.md#Perfect square | perfect square]]**, then we write it's factor only once.
- Like factors of $36$ as $\{1, 36\}, \{2, 18\}, \{3, 12\}, \{4, 9\}, \{6\}$

#### Perfect square
- A number is a perfect square if it's square root is also an *integer*.
- So, $16$ is a perfect square, because $4^2 = 16$.
- Examples: $0, 1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, \dots$
- $0$ is also a perfect square, because $\sqrt{0} = 0$, similarly 1.

### Prime numbers
- A number is prime, if it only divides by $1$ and the number itself.
- So, a prime number $p$ has only $2$ factors, $\{1, p\}$
- $1$ is not a prime, because it has only one factor i.e. $\{1\}$.
- A prime number must have only $2$ factors, not less not more.
- Some prime numbers are: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, \dots$
- There is a **Sieve of Eratosthenes** algorithm, which says that:
- - Take numbers from $2$ to $n$.
- - Let $p = 2$, first prime number.
- - Cut all the numbers which are multiple of $p$ i.e. $2$.
- - When there's no multiple left, take $p = 3$ and cut it's multiples.
- - And by doing this, we will end up getting all prime numbers till $n$.

#### Prime Factorization

- Every number can be factorize into prime numbers.
- So, prime factorization of $12$ is $12 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 2^2 \cdot 3$
- Similarly, $126$ can be written as: $126 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 = 2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7$
